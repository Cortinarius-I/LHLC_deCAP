Color day is an activity which we take up in the 1st month of the academic year. Every week we choose a particular colour. The centre is decorated with the chosen color. Balloons, ribbons and other objects are given to the students. The staff and kids wear dresses of the chosen color. There is a show and tell activity for the students. They are also given lots of colouring and painting activities. We cover 8 colours over 8 weeks.
