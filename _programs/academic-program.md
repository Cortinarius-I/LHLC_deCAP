Curriculum is an important part of any educational system. In Little Hearts Learning Centre we follow a functional curriculum for academics viz English, Math and science. These subjects are taught through concrete activities which enhance their understanding. However, the goals are set according to the profile of the student and the methodology is based on the learning style of the student. We also use computers to teach the subjects.
