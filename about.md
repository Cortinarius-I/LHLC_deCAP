## Our Journey

Little Hearts Learning Centre was founded by Gowri Ramesh and Reshmy Nikith in 2009. It was established to fulfil the growing need for a local professional setup catering to the educational and functional needs of differently-abled children and adults. Beginning in a 100 sq.ft area with a strength of 6 children, 2 professionals and 4 volunteers, we have grown considerably and now cater to 50 children with a staff strength of 31. The organisation will continue to spread its wings and we intend to expand into the field of vocational training, based on a skill development programme we have formulated which is geared towards employability and social inclusion.

## Why Little Hearts Learning Centre?

We constantly endeavor to provide our students with a holistic learning environment which is conducive to their continuous growth and progress. We help in aiding the development of their independence, functional skills, educational skills, social skills, and vocational skills. Our programs are catered to the unique needs of our students, as a result of which we work towards achieving individual milestones for each of our students. Through our work, we aim towards shaping an inclusive society, and additionally, we aim to empower each of our students so that they can live independently and with dignity.

## Vision

## Mission
