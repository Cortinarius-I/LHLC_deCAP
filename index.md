about:
  journey: Little Hearts Learning Centre was founded by Gowri Ramesh and Reshmy
    Nikith in 2009. It was established to fulfil the growing need for a local
    professional setup catering to the educational and functional needs of
    differently-abled children and adults. Beginning in a 100 sq.ft area with a
    strength of 6 children, 2 professionals and 4 volunteers, we have grown
    considerably and now cater to 65 children with a staff strength of 31. The
    organisation will continue to spread its wings and we intend to expand into
    the field of vocational training, based on a skill development programme we
    have formulated which is geared towards employability and social inclusion.
  why: We constantly endeavour to provide our students with a holistic learning
    environment which is conducive to their continuous growth and progress. We
    help in aiding the development of their independence, functional skills,
    educational skills, social skills, and vocational skills. Our programmes are
    catered to the unique needs of our students, as a result of which we work
    towards achieving individual milestones for each of our students. Through
    our work, we aim towards shaping an inclusive society, and additionally, we
    aim to empower each of our students so that they can live independently and
    with dignity.
  vision: Equal educational opportunities for all.
  mission: To increase social acceptance of special children in the educational
    system and advocate equal rights for education through interventions that
    develop their skills and maximize their potentials.
